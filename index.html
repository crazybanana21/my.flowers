  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <p>
    <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> is great. It defines the structure of webpages and it determines how data is displayed online. <br>
    What you're looking at right now is HTML code, read and interpreted by your browser. But this <br>
    doesn't make HTML a <del>programming language</del>.

  <strong>A Markup Language</strong> <br>
  HTML is a type of markup language. It encapsulates, or "marks up" data within HTML tags. The <br>
  HTML describes the data to the browser, and the browser then displays the data accordingly.
  
  
     <hr>
    For example: <br>
    If we want to write the chemical equation H<sub>2</sub>+0<sub>2</sub>=<sub>2</sub>0 <br>
    or Mathematical equation X<sup>3</sup>+Y<sup>5</sup>=Z<sup>12</sup> <br>
    or Special characters & @ <br>
    you should use the suitable tag for each one ;)
